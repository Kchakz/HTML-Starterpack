# HTML-Starterpack
note: this is all to be edited, the information in this repository is purely to have a steady start to web development.
This is all information directly from wikipedia.
Please, to whome ever might be affected by my source, this is not a project of any sort, this is just to help newcomers to HTML and CSS.

Thank you :D
